# Streamlit Stock Portfolio Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze the performance of a stock portfolio. It allows users to monitor key portfolio metrics over time and gain insights into overall investment performance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Portfolio Value Over Time Chart:**  Visualizes the growth and trend of the portfolio value across a selected date range.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays essential metrics such as Total Return, Average Daily Return, Volatility (as Standard Deviation), and (conceptually) Sharpe Ratio.
*   **Portfolio Composition Visualization:** Presents the current allocation of assets within the portfolio using a Donut chart, showing the weight or value of each stock holding.
*   **Interactive Date Range Selection:**  Allows users to dynamically filter the dashboard to analyze performance over different time periods (e.g., last month, year-to-date, custom range).

**3. README.md for Credit Risk Assessment Dashboard**

```markdown
# Streamlit Credit Risk Assessment Dashboard

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides a dashboard to visualize and explore credit risk assessment data. It presents key metrics related to loan default risk and allows for interactive analysis of risk factors and customer segments (basic segmentation in this example).

**Key Features:**

*   **Overall Default Rate Metric:** Displays the average default rate, providing a high-level overview of portfolio risk.
*   **Credit Score Distribution Histogram:**  Visualizes the distribution of applicant credit scores, showing the spread of risk levels in the applicant pool.
*   **Simplified Key Risk Factor Table:**  Provides a qualitative example table highlighting some factors generally associated with higher credit risk (simplified in this example - real dashboards would use feature importance from models).
*   **Loan Purpose Filter:**  Uses a dropdown to allow users to filter the dashboard and analyze default rates and credit score distributions for specific loan purposes (e.g., Home Improvement Loans, Car Loans).

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd your-credit-risk-dashboard-project-folder
    ```
3.  **Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed.** If not, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly numpy
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run credit_risk_streamlit_app.py
    ```
    (Replace `credit_risk_streamlit_app.py` with your filename).
5.  **Open the Streamlit app in your browser.**

## Data Source

This dashboard uses **synthetic credit risk data** generated within the Python script to illustrate the dashboard's functionality.

**For a real-world credit risk application**, you would use:

*   **Real Credit Application Datasets:** Such as datasets from Kaggle competitions (like "Home Credit Default Risk") or anonymized datasets from financial institutions (if access is available).
*   **Data from Credit Bureaus and Risk Modeling Systems:** For actual risk assessment and scoring.

## Libraries Used

*   Python
*   Streamlit
*   Pandas
*   Plotly Express
*   NumPy

## Further Development Ideas

*   Integrate a real credit scoring model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) and visualize feature importance or model predictions directly.
*   Develop more detailed customer segmentation based on risk profiles.
*   Implement geographic risk visualizations (if location data is available and used ethically).
*   Add interactive features to explore the impact of different risk factors on default probability.

**4. README.md for Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization Dashboard**

```markdown
# Streamlit Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization Dashboard

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides a dashboard for visualizing sales trends, demand forecasts, and basic inventory optimization concepts. It presents historical and predicted sales data, forecast accuracy metrics, and serves as a foundation for more advanced inventory management analysis.

**Key Features:**

*   **Historical vs. Forecasted Sales Line Chart:** Compares actual past sales against forecasted sales trends for selected product categories.
*   **Forecast Accuracy Metrics (MAPE & RMSE):** Displays Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify forecast model performance.
*   **Product Category Filter:** Allows users to select a specific product category to analyze its sales trends and forecast separately.
*   **Placeholder for Trend Decomposition Visualization:**  (In this example, a placeholder notes where a more advanced time series decomposition visualization could be implemented to break down sales into trend, seasonality, and residual components.)
*   **Placeholder for Inventory Management Page:** (Indicates where inventory-related metrics and visualizations, like inventory levels, days of supply, etc., would be included in a more developed dashboard).

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd your-demand-forecasting-dashboard-project-folder
    ```
3.  **Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed.** If not, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly numpy scikit-learn
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run demand_forecast_streamlit_app.py
    ```
    (Replace `demand_forecast_streamlit_app.py` with your filename).
5.  **Open the Streamlit app in your browser.**

## Data Source

This dashboard uses **synthetic retail sales data** generated within the Python script for demonstration and to showcase basic forecasting concepts.

**In a real-world demand forecasting application**, you would use:

*   **Historical Sales Data:** From retail systems, e-commerce platforms, or sales databases.
*   **Demand Forecasting Models:** Implement more sophisticated time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet) or machine learning models for demand prediction.
*   **Inventory Data:**  For a complete inventory optimization dashboard, you would also need data on inventory levels, stock keeping units (SKUs), reorder points, lead times, and potentially costs.

## Libraries Used

*   Python
*   Streamlit
*   Pandas
*   Plotly Express
*   NumPy
*   Scikit-learn (for forecast accuracy metrics)

## Further Development Ideas

*   Implement time series decomposition visualization to show trend, seasonality, and residuals.
*   Replace the simplified placeholder forecast with a more advanced forecasting model.
*   Develop the "Inventory Management" page with visualizations of inventory levels, days of supply, inventory turnover rate, and potentially stockout risk simulation.
*   Add interactive time period selection (e.g., analyze sales by month, quarter, year).
*   Explore drill-down capabilities into store-level, regional, or product-level sales data (depending on data availability).
*   [Optionally, add screenshots of your dashboard here in the README]
